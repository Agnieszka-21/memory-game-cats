UPDATE

### Typography

Two font families are imported from Google fonts and used across all pages:

- __Lobster, weight 400__  
  - A sans-serif font that slightly resembles handwriting, Lobster is used for the main title (h1 and h2) on the landing page of the game. This style works well for larger font sizes.
  - This font is not used anywhere else in order to keep it as a "signature font" for the page title so that it is easily recognizable. 

- __Roboto Condensed, weights from 100 to 900, the entire font family__
  - Also a sans-serif font, Roboto Condensed is used for any regular and bold text in this web application.
  - It is simple and easily legible.
